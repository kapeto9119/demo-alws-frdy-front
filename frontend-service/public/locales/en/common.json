  "description": "Hi there! I'm NicolÃ¡s Capetillo, a software engineer who's dabbled in various areas of the industry (IoT, Backend development, Cloud and infrastructure developmentâ€”you know, the usual), though when it comes to front-end... well, let's just say I'm more of a backstage kind of guy, haha. I'm methodical, responsible, and (I think) pretty pleasant to work with. I love business and innovation, so much so that I decided to take on the challenge of a masterâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering, focusing on ICT Engineering, Business and Innovation, which, conveniently, fits perfectly with my professional profile. Nice to meet me! ðŸ˜„",
